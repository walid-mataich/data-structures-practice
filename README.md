# Data Structures Practice: Stacks and Queues in C
This project is a practice exercise for implementing basic data structures in C. It focuses on stacks (piles) and queues (files) using dynamic memory allocation and linked lists.

It is my first project uploaded to GitHub, marking the start of my journey in mastering data structures and version control.
